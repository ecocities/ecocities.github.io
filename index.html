		<h2>#N30</h2>
		<p>
	On November 30th, 2019 we'll be connecting many cities around the world -- both in-person, and remotely via video chat -- to experiment, discuss, and plan around the upcoming People's Climate Summit in early December, which will be occurring globally in parallel with The UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid.</p>
		
		<p>
Weâ€™ll kick off the event with a few videos on the history of internationally-coordinated media activism, then switch gears with live video/chat conversations and presentations in which we share ideas for projects, tools, interventions, and media experiments that might help coordinate and support international climate activism.</p>
